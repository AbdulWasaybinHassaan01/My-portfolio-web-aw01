                    <p class="par">Victor Stuesse is the recipient of this year&rsquo;s Lacie Award, dedicated to
                        honoring the work of a professor who has touched lives both inside and outside of the Roux
                        community. As a teacher, Professor Stuesse has ushered over 900 students through the Craft +
                        Design program, and has always been willing to share the secrets of his craft. As a sculptor and
                        restorer, he has donated his time to public works projects such as the Central Park Arts
                        Maintenance Council and the Metropolitan Museum&rsquo;s docent program.</p><br>
                    <p class="par">Professor Stuesse has had a long and successful career in the arts, having received
                        many commissions over the years in cities from Chicago to Bangkok, but always returns to
                        &ldquo;the job I call a dream.&rdquo; For his dedication to teaching and community involvement,
                        the Roux Academy is proud to award him with this year&rsquo;s prize, which also includes a
                        stipend for pursuit of personal projects outside the academy. Congratulations, Professor
                        Stuesse!</p>
